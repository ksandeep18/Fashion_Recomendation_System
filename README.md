# 🖼️ Image Similarity Search (ResNet50 + kNN) — Why Explanations

---

## 📌 Feature Extraction — Why?

- **Import libraries** → We need TensorFlow for pretrained models, NumPy for math, pickle for saving embeddings, and tqdm for usability.  
- **Load ResNet50 (include_top=False)** → Use ImageNet pretrained backbone without classification head; we only want feature maps.  
- **Freeze weights** → We don’t need to train, just extract features.  
- **GlobalMaxPooling2D** → Converts spatial (7x7x2048) feature map into compact (2048,) descriptor.  
- **Preprocess input** → Matches training distribution (BGR, mean subtraction) used for ResNet.  
- **Flatten output** → Ensures a 1D vector, easy to save and compare.  
- **L2 Normalization** → Ensures all embeddings lie on a unit sphere → robust similarity comparisons.  
- **Loop over images** → Build dataset of embeddings.  
- **Save with pickle** → So we don’t recompute embeddings every time.

## 📌 Retrieval — Why?

- **Reload embeddings and filenames** → Needed for searching database.  
- **Rebuild the same ResNet50 model** → Consistency between database and query embeddings.  
- **Load and preprocess query image** → Must match training and database preprocessing.  
- **Normalize query embedding** → Makes it comparable with normalized dataset vectors.  
- **Use NearestNeighbors (brute, euclidean)** → Simple exact search; with normalized vectors, Euclidean ≈ cosine similarity.  
- **Request 6 neighbors** → First is the query itself, next 5 are top matches.  
- **Display results** → Visual confirmation of retrieval success.

## 📊 Why Normalize Features?

- Removes brightness/scale influence.  
- Makes cosine similarity = dot product.  
- Prevents large-magnitude vectors from dominating distance comparisons.

## 🚀 Why Improvements Suggested?

- **Batching** → Faster inference.  
- **.npy instead of .pkl** → Quicker save/load.  
- **FAISS instead of brute kNN** → Scales to millions of images.
